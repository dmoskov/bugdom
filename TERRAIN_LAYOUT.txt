LEGEND:
  ⬤  = Rock obstacle (7 total, sizes 1.4-2.2 units)
  🌸 = Flower (8 total, pink/yellow/orange)
  F  = Fence post (boundary marker)
  +  = Corner boundary

TERRAIN FEATURES:
─────────────────

Ground Plane:
  • Size: 100x100 units
  • Color: Grass green (#4a9d2e)
  • Vertex displacement: ±0.3 units for natural look
  • 20 darker grass patches randomly scattered
  • Receives shadows

Rocks (Obstacles):
  • 7 dodecahedron shapes
  • Sizes: 1.4 to 2.2 units
  • Color: Gray (#808080)
  • Randomized rotation and shape variation
  • Cast and receive shadows
  • Tagged with userData.obstacle = true

Flowers:
  • 8 flowers with stems and petals
  • Stem: Green cylinder, 0.05 radius, 1 unit tall
  • Petals: 6 spherical petals arranged in circle
  • Colors: Pink (#ff69b4), Yellow (#ffff00), Orange (#ffa500)
  • Center: Yellow sphere
  • Tagged with userData.obstacle = true

Boundaries:
  • Invisible walls at ±50 units (N/S/E/W)
  • Fence posts every 10 units as visual markers
  • Brown wooden posts (#8b4513), 0.2 radius, 2 units tall
  • Camera movement clamped to ±45 units

LIGHTING SETUP:
───────────────
  • Ambient: 0.6 intensity, white
  • Directional: 0.8 intensity, from (50, 50, 50)
  • Shadow mapping enabled (2048x2048)
  • Sky blue background (#87ceeb) with fog

CAMERA & CONTROLS:
──────────────────
  • PerspectiveCamera, 75° FOV
  • Starting position: (0, 5, 10)
  • Movement: WASD or Arrow Keys (0.2 units/frame)
  • Look: Mouse movement
  • Rotation limits: ±45° vertical
  • Boundary: Stays within ±45 units

FILE STRUCTURE:
───────────────
  /index.html         - Entry point with UI overlay
  /src/main.js        - Main Three.js scene (350+ lines)
  /package.json       - Dependencies (three@0.160.0, vite@5.0.0)
  /vite.config.js     - Dev server config
  /README.md          - Documentation

TESTING READY FOR:
──────────────────
  ✓ Player movement in 3D space
  ✓ Obstacle collision detection (rocks, flowers marked)
  ✓ Boundary constraints
  ✓ Camera controls and viewport
  ✓ Shadow rendering
  ✓ Scene performance

NEXT STEPS:
───────────
  • Add player character model
  • Implement physics-based collision detection
  • Add more detailed grass/rock textures
  • Implement sound effects
  • Add particle effects (grass movement, etc.)
